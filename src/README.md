**Assignment 2**

This assignment consists of two parts: Entropy of Language and Commit Owners. 
It is implemented in Java and consists of two packages that contain the solution of each part, 
respectively.  Moreover, a folder is part of the project. It contains the text files that are 
required for the first part of the assignment. 

The first part of the assignment measures the entropy of the Albanian language.  For this purpose, 
it uses two text files. Moreover, it allows the user to enter a sentence ,and it displays the language 
that this sentence belongs to (English/Albanian). 
The second part of the assignment is designed to solve the problem of 
extracting the employees that have performed commits in a distributed version control platform, 
given as input the weld, which is the concatenated value of committersâ€™ id and a text file 
which contains the necessary data related to the employees' names, surnames and ids. 

For more detailed information please refer to the attached documentation. 

**NOTE**
If the output of the second part of the assignment indicates some committer names ,but the number
of decompositions is 0, it means that only some parts of the weld can be interpreted as the id of an 
employee, there are no corresponding employees for the entire weld.
